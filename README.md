# DNA and Protein Sequence Operations using Biopython

This project demonstrates essential bioinformatics operations on DNA and protein sequences using the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) library. It includes functionalities such as:

- Generating the reverse complement of a DNA sequence
- Transcribing DNA to RNA
- Translating DNA to a protein sequence
- Calculating the molecular weight of a protein

## Features

âœ… Reverse complement of a DNA sequence  
âœ… Transcription of DNA to RNA  
âœ… Translation of DNA to protein  
âœ… Molecular weight calculation for a protein sequence

## ðŸ§¬ Code Overview

### 1. Reverse Complement of DNA
Generates the reverse complement of a given DNA sequence using `Seq.reverse_complement()`.

### 2. Transcription to RNA
Converts DNA to RNA using `Seq.transcribe()`.

### 3. Translation to Protein
Translates a DNA sequence into a protein using `Seq.translate()`.

### 4. Protein Molecular Weight
Calculates the molecular weight of a given protein using `molecular_weight()` from `Bio.SeqUtils`.
